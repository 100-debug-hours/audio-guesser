# audio-guesser website


## Rationale
This project was created as a test task for [int20h hackathon 2020](https://int20h.best-kyiv.org/).


The website ebables users to search music by recording a sample audio-track that
resembles the original sound or by looking it up via an excerpt of lyrics, music title
or author's name.
